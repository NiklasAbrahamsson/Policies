        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 18, 2026</p>

        <p>This privacy policy applies to apps published by Niklas Abrahamsson ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information when you use our apps.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Our apps do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. We do not require you to create an account, provide your name, email address, or any other personal details to use our apps.</p>

        <h2>Tracking and Analytics</h2>
        <p>Our apps do not use any tracking technologies. We do not use analytics services, cookies, advertising identifiers, or any other mechanism to track your activity or behavior.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our apps do not integrate any third-party services that collect data. There are no ad networks, analytics SDKs, social media integrations, or other external services embedded in our apps.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Because we do not collect any personal data, there is no data to share with third parties. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any information to outside parties.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our apps do not collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, our apps comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as it relates to children's data.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since our apps do not collect or store any personal data, there is no user data at risk. No information is stored on our servers or on your device beyond the app itself.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
